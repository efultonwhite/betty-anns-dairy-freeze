<h1>Welcome to Betty Ann's Dairy Freeze</h1>
	<div>
		<p>For those of you who didn't know, Betty Ann's was first established in 1955 by a very well-known man named Gus Wagner, and he named it after both his wife, Betty and his daughter, Ann. Many times since the White family has taken over have we
			heard so many great stories from grandchildren of Mr. Wagner, the the generations of predecessors that have ran the business after the Wagner's, and from previous employees that have fantastic memories of being apart of this wonderful
			establishment. We are thrilled the memories continue and we get to be apart of that!</p>

		<p>We are proud to continue the tradition of serving premium soft serve flavors to visitors - locally and afar - since 1955!</p>

		<p>In addition to our premium soft serve, we serve also locally made regular hard icecream. We offer traditional and custom sundaes, milk shakes, and cones.</p>

		<p>Check out our menu to find your classic parlor favorites, like Lime Rickey or Root Beer Float - or perhaps discover something new!</p>
